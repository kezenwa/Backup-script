CHRONOS is a shell script, designed to perform different backups on a local computer. It makes a compressed archive of all backup selected in the configuration. It can also encrypt the archive, and upload it on a FTP server, or copy it via SCP.

This script is designed to be executed in command line, or via a cron job. You can also copy it into /etc/cron.daily for a daily execution.

    * Backup a selection of files and/or directories.
    * Backup MySQL databases.
    * Backup users' homes directories (full or only hidden configuration files).
    * Backup the list of installed packages (Debian / Ubuntu).
    * Encrypt the final archive using GPG.
    * Upload final archive via FTP (using ftp-upload) and/or SCP.
    * Send a report by email.

Installation :
